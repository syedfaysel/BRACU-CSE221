# TO DO
# This method must be completed by you
# You should code in such a way that the output should be
 # 1 -> 2,4
 # 2 -> 4
 # 3 -> 1,4
 # 4 -> 2
# notice this method takes both the graphs as parameters
# this means you have print the same output in the same style for both the datastructures
# if graph is none then print from listGraph
# if listGraph is none then print from graph

# TO DO
# I have shown you how to build a graph using a dictionary of list
# now your job is to build a graph using list of lists [[E,B],[C,D]]
# it means A -> E,B and B -> C,D
